# Unfortunately, pydub currently doesn't support native 
# conversion of MP3 to MP4A due to limitations with the 
# underlying library it uses (libav) on M1 Macs. However, 
# there are still ways to achieve this conversion using 
# pydub in conjunction with other tools: https://g.co/gemini/share/a95ce5d1d79a
